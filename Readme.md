# Stationery Shop Management System
A robust backend application built using Express and TypeScript to manage a stationery shop's products and orders. The system integrates MongoDB with Mongoose for efficient data management and enforces data integrity through schema validation.

## Features
### CRUD Operation
* Stationery Products
    * Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
    * Enforce category validation using an enum (e.g., Writing, Office Supplies, Art Supplies).
* Orders:
    * Place and view orders linked to specific stationery products.

### Validation
* Mongoose schema validation for data integrity.
* Strict TypeScript types to ensure code reliability.

### Data Relationships
* Orders reference Stationery Products by ObjectId for relational data handling.

### Schema model
1. **Stationery Product Model**
   - **name** (string): The name of the product (e.g., Pen, Notebook, Eraser).
   - **brand** (string): The brand of the product (e.g., Pilot, Moleskine, Faber-Castell).
   - **price** (number): Price of the product.
